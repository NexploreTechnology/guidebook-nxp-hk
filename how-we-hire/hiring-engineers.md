## 1. Philosophy

- We believe Nexplore is one of the technology-oriented companies
- To us, coding ability will be an essential quality of engineers of ANY LEVELs
- Candidates should expect to demonstrate the coding skills at some point

## 2. Process

Candidates should expect there will be 2 interviews + 1 take home assignment

### 2.1. Video - Matching Interview (1 hour)

#### 2.1.1. Introduction

- The candidate can do a short introduction:
  - professional background
  - software projects worked / working on
  - technical / non-technical engineering skills
- The candidate can also learn more what and how software engineers in Nexplore are doing
- This is a session to understand each other, and see if the position is a good fit for both

#### 2.1.2. Technical Discussion

- The interviewer(s) will go through some of the technical topics with the candidate
  - focuses on both technical breadth and technical depth of the candidate
- The interviewer(s) will NOT expect the candidate will know everything. Neither the interviewer(s)!
  - Relax!

#### 2.1.3. Non-technical Discussion

- Role(s) on development cycles
- Reasons for applying
- Expectations on your role

### 2.2. Take-home Assignment (At most 6 hours)

- The take-home assignment should be simple and straight-forward
  - Although a working software will be the primary measure,
  - Good engineering practices will show the engineers to be proficient:
    - concise
    - future proof
    - developer favour

### 2.3. Video - Feedback & Deep Dive Interview (1 hour)

- Review and discuss on the assignment the candidate worked on
- Focus more on the behaviours of the candidate, the candidate might expect that there can be some case studies or non-engineering discussion on
  - team communications
  - engineering processes
  - product requirement & quality
  - career visions
  - (Senior) team management
  - (Senior) resource planning
