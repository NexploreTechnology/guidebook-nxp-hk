# Design Patterns <!-- omit in toc -->

## Three Categories

1. Creational patterns (Usability)
   1. Most beneficial in strongly-typed and statically-typed languages to reuse the code
   2. Less critical in dynamic languages like JavaScript where classes are not enforced at compile time
2. Structural patterns (Understandability)
   1. Widely applicable across different programming paradigms
   2. Help organize and structure business logic code into smaller, manageable components
3. Behavioural patterns (Complexity)
   1. Manage data flow and communication between objects efficiently
   2. Reduce complexity in handling data dependencies and state management
