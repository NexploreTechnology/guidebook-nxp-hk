## Objectives

- Make collaborative decisions requiring multiple stakeholders' input
- Share critical information and updates with relevant team members

## Before the meeting

### Notify early

- Announce meetings well in advance to allow proper preparation
- Late notices risk poor preparation, venue unavailability, scheduling conflicts, and reduced meeting effectiveness

### Good meeting name

Be direct and clear

- Meeting :x: no context
- Sharing :x: is worth to join?
- Inspection Print Form Analysis :o:
- Team Panda Express Sprint 5 Review :o:

### Good meeting time

Ensure the meeting does not disrupt the normal work schedule

- in the middle of work time :x: halfway through
- very late in the day :x: overrun
- before lunchtime :o:
- after lunchtime :o:
- near the start of the day :o:

### Good invitation notes

Include the meeting content

- An agenda
- Possible expected outcomes
- Meeting materials (highly recommended)
  - graphical illustrations
    - Sketches
    - UMLs
    - Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)
    - Mockups
    - Wire frames
    - etc
  - actual figures
    - charts
    - summary tables
  - real life samples

### Relevant participants

- Invite relevant people only :crown:
- Invite other people to audit, but make it clear their attendance is optional

### Duration of the meeting

30 mins is the most ideal :blush:

- Be avoid to have meeting longer than 1 hour :tired_face:
- Always prefer multiple short sessions instead :fast_forward:

## During the meeting

1. If there are more than 10 people in the room, probably it is not a meeting but an announcement
2. A random, lengthy meeting is useless
3. A meeting without interactions is not a meeting
4. A meeting note should be updated and visible during the meeting
5. It can help people to ask relevant questions and clarify the unknowns

## After the meeting

### Conclusion

A conclusion/summary should often be sent after the meeting

- If there is no conclusion / summary, this meeting might not be necessary

### Action Plan

Specify clearly

- `What` to do
- `Who` to manage who to manage
- `When` to start and finish
