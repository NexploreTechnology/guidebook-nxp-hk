## Handle production data

- ANY data patches should be prepared as a query script
- All query scripts should be reviewed before executed
- The original records should be backup in some kind
- All scripts should present some ways to demonstrate your change is effective
  - `returning *`
  - all additional select statements
- There MUST be at least one engineers as observers
- A transaction is ALWAYS required
- `commit` should be invoked until the observers AGREE to do so

```sql
BEGIN;

SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE id IN ('user1', 'user2', 'user3');

UPDATE "users" SET name = name || '-SMART' WHERE id IN ('user1', 'user2', 'user3') RETURNING *;

SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE id IN ('user1', 'user2', 'user3');

COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;
```

## Data Backup

### Patch Data: A few Records

simply export the whole rows in a CSV file

### Patch Data: Whole Table / A few Tables

try to back up the original data in-place

```sql
CREATE TABLE users_20240227 AS
SELECT * FROM users;
```

### Patch Data: Several Tables

dump the whole database
