# Backlog Refinement / Review

# Agenda

- Review what tasks remain
- Review sprint statistics
  - `Burnup Chart`
  - `Velocity Chart`
  - `Control Chart`
  - To To understsand *scope change*, *velocity shift* and *reasons why not starting some tasks*
- Introduce, discuss and estimate the tasks
- Note uncertain things and assign someone responsible to clarify the requirements
- AGREE on the [sprint goal(s)](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-sprint-goal) - no more than three
- Decide what should be done and what should not be done

## Story points
**We should `NOT` start any development if there are no estimation in the tasks**

`Fibonacci number` will be a [good](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/why-the-fibonacci-sequence-works-well-for-estimating "https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/why-the-fibonacci-sequence-works-well-for-estimating") tool to follow:

Assign the number of story points to a task by:

1. the amount of understanding
2. the effort to implement
3. the testing effort on `developers`

### Meaning of each number

- 1 (very easy, can be done in less than 1 hour)
- 2 (easy, but need time to implement and verify, maybe need to spend 1 to several hours)
- 3 (medium, expected to spend around 1 day to finish it)
- 5 (complicated, expected days)

** Break down the task if larger than 5  **
- 8 (very complicated, expected a week)
- 13 (it will be super huge that we cannot imagine, even cant estiamte the timeline)
- [spike](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-spike "https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/what-is-scrum-spike")

It is possible we say it is a `spike`, which means we do not have any ideas how it is going to implement.
